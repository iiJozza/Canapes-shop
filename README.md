# Ms Hors D'oeuvre

Ms hors d'oeuvre is a site that brings catering to an easily navigatable site where people can see 
what are offered and to what price. This will also make ordering much easier and lets the existing and new costumers have a hub of sorts instead of going to multiple sites. Having multiple steps in your ordering process gives the customer more time to reconsider and therefore not order anything. An example of this is going to instagram for the food/reviews and sending an email to order which makes the ordering process more time consuming. And time is not something people want to waste.

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your projectâ€™s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
