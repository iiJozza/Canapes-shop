# Ms Hors D'oeuvre

Ms hors d'oeuvre is a site that brings catering to an easily navigatable site where people can see 
what is on offer and to what price. This will also make ordering much easier and leads existing and new customers to their own "hub", instead of going to multiple sites. Having multiple steps in your ordering process opens the opportunity for the customer to reconsider and consequentially or order nothing. An example of this is going to instagram for the food/reviews and as an extra step place an email order, which makes the ordering process more time consuming. And time is not something people want to waste.

## Features

An overview of all my existing features, what I want to improve and features I want to implement in the future.

### Existing Features

- __The Navigation Bar__

  - Identical on all pages and offers  easy navigation to the different portions of the site -- Home, Shop and Feedback.
  - The current page is displayed on the navigation bar in bold text and when hovered over the text turns red. This makes it much easier for the user to understand where in the website they are positioned.
  - Different navigation bars have been created depending on and to accomodated various screensizes.

- __The Landing Page__

  - The landing page image for mobiles provides the user with a playful feeling and enables them to experience food with an artistic content.  
  - The image offered on larger screens is more inviting and gives a more direct feeling that this webpage is about food.
  - The text showcases the company's branding style and also that the products and concept is luxury-orientated.

### Features Left to Implement

Unfortunately there is a lot that I would love to implement and redo, but due to time constraint can't. 

- Shop Improvements
  - One of the major implementetion I would do is to change the whole shop page. It is a gallery currently but I tried to make an interactive shop before I understood it was not possible at the current time. The idea I had was that the food items would align underneath each other one by one (2 by 2 or 3 by 3 on larger sceeens)
  - Clicking the picture opens up a dropdown list revealing the ingredienses.
  - On top of each image would be a title of the food item and a small icon if it was either gluten-free, vegan, vegeterian or lactos-free. 
  - The image should also go down in opacity after 70% of the image revealing the price/10. 
  - Scaling the images to be the same sizes in the shop
  - Add more images to the site that is what is currently on the menu. 
- 

- Footer
  - Currently the foot is very bare. I want to implement a contect list with email, telefonnumber, name of the company and adress with a google maps embedded. 

- Index
  - I wanted the images in the event section to go zig-zag on larger screens, making the site more apealing.
  
- Hero image
  - I accidently downloaded the wrong size for my background image making it stretch way too much on screen-sizes larger than mobile since the height was so much longer than the width.
  - Consistent hero image. Currently there are a two which is very confusing and can cause people to back out of the site due to not recognising the background.

- Feedback
  - My feedback page is unfortunately not that resposive and the feedback section goes into the comments if you reduces the screen height. 
  - I want to implement a real comment section where comments show up in real-time with their names attached to them. The styling is also something I would change but have no ideas as of yet.

- Deleting The Thank You Page
  - There is no reason to have a page like that if the feedback controlls that aspect.

- New Pages
  - I want to add a real gallery. How it looks now is ok, but I want it to have a more apealing look to it. It is very boring at the moment.
  - I want to implement a new history page as well where it describes its journey and shows all its accolades 

- Adding a real icon to the site.
